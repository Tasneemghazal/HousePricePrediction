# AI Assignment: House Price Prediction

## Introduction
This repository contains an AI assignment project for predicting house prices using the [House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). The assignment explores the implementation of machine learning algorithms, specifically Decision Tree Regressor and XGBoost, for predicting house prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this assignment is the [House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) available on Kaggle. It includes information about house sales, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and sale prices.

## Decision Tree Regressor
The Decision Tree Regressor is a key algorithm used in this assignment. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm suitable for regression tasks, making it effective for predicting numerical values such as house prices.

## XGBoost
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is another algorithm explored in this assignment. It is an ensemble learning algorithm known for its speed and performance, making it suitable for regression tasks like predicting house prices.
